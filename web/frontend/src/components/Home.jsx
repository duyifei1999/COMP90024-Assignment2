              The topic of liveability has gained significant attention through
              social media platforms over the recent years. Nowadays, Twitter is
              one of the most popular online social media platforms, where users
              can share and communicate their opinions with each other from all
              over the world. Given the increasing popularity and importance of
              online social media networks such as Twitter, it is not surprising
              that a tremendous amount of sharing and discussion of information
              has occurred in such platforms.

              With respect to the indicators of Melbourne housing and
              opportunity, the objective of the scenario that was chosen for
              this assignment was to analyze the liveability of Melbourne by
              harvesting tweets. Meanwhile, statistical data could be downloaded
              from the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN)
              and thereby be used to compare with the twitter data.
